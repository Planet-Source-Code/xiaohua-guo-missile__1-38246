'   at the start of a new level, the background picture of the game window is copied onto cleanscreen and workscr (getcleanscreen sub)
'   when the game begins, the first thing the do animation does is copy the whole cleanscreen image onto workscr picbox
'   after the workscreen is reset with the original picture, the sprites start to be drawn on there, when all sprites are drawn...
'   the workscr picture is copyed to the gamewindow for player to see, so the animation works in background form (frmsprites) while player plays game
'brief description of how individual sprites are copied onto the workscreen with transparency
'   every sprite that is suppose to show will get it's mask to AND into the workscreen(so the white will not be drawn),
'   then OR the real image onto the masked part (so the back is not draw, now you get a sprite
'   ** now this is a very slow way compared to directx direct draw, but it will make flicker free animation...

' Reset Background, make workpage clean again
' each frame will be completely redrawn, meaning background reset etc, instead of repairing the parts that need to be repaired after a frame,
' i chose this way because in later levels 15, 16, etc things will be all over the screen and to repair parts of the background when there are so
