** if you have to scroll horizontally in notepad, click edit/word wrap, i still cant believe some people dont' have that on


this game was written by me(Defiant or Xiaohua Guo) for my school project in vb class, you've got to remember i had to comment almost everyline because the teacher is reading my work so it was neccessary. this game will be helpful for beginners of vb and people who want to learn how to make a game in vb, although i'm learning direct x so i can make a real game because vb can't make a game by it self. 

if you have any suggestions or comments(OR HELP ME WITH BUGS), email me at xiaohuaguo@hotmail.com
